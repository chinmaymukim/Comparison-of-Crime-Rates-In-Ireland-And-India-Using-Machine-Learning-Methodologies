# Comparison-of-Crime-Rates-In-Ireland-And-India-Using-Machine-Learning-Methodologies
📌 Project Overview

This repository contains my Master’s Thesis completed as part of the MSc in Data Analytics at National College of Ireland (Oct 2022 – Dec 2022).

The project focuses on a comparative analysis of crime rates in Ireland and India using machine learning and time series forecasting methodologies. The aim was to identify key socio-economic drivers of crime and evaluate the effectiveness of different predictive models to support data-driven policy decisions.

🎯 Objectives

Compare crime trends between Ireland and India

Analyze the impact of unemployment and population growth on crime rates

Apply and evaluate multiple machine learning and time series models

Identify the most accurate predictive model for crime forecasting

Provide insights to support policy formulation and crime prevention strategies

🧠 Methodology
📂 Data Sources

Government and public datasets from Ireland and India

Crime statistics, population data, and unemployment rates

Time-series structured data spanning multiple years

🛠 Data Processing

Data cleaning and normalization

Feature engineering for socio-economic indicators

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends and correlations

🤖 Models Implemented

The following models were implemented and compared:

Model	Purpose
Linear Regression	Baseline predictive modeling
ARIMA	Time series forecasting
Exponential Smoothing	Trend and seasonality modeling
📈 Key Findings & Results

✔ Unemployment is a stronger predictor of crime than population growth in both Ireland and India
✔ Linear Regression outperformed ARIMA and Exponential Smoothing in prediction accuracy
✔ Crime trends showed similar socio-economic sensitivities across both countries
✔ Time series models captured trends, but regression provided clearer interpretability

📌 Conclusion:
Simple, interpretable models like Linear Regression can outperform complex time-series methods when socio-economic factors strongly influence outcomes.

🏆 Impact

Demonstrates practical application of machine learning in social science

Provides actionable insights for policy makers and law enforcement agencies

Highlights the importance of unemployment mitigation in crime prevention

Serves as a strong academic and professional data analytics portfolio project
